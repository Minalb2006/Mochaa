    <h1>Types Of Variable</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>* Let</h2>
<p>• let is used to declare a variable in JavaScript.</p>

<p>• A variable declared with let can be changed later (reassigned).</p>

<p>• let has block scope — it works only inside the { } block where it is defined.</p>

<p>• You cannot redeclare the same let variable in the same block. </p>
        <pre>
<b>Example:</b>
let name="Paurnima Bawane";
console.log(name);
<br>
<b>Output</b>
Paurnima Bawane
    </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>* Var</h2>
        <p>var is used to declare a variable.</p>

 <p>• It has function scope (not block scope).</p>
<p>• You can redeclare and reassign a variable declared with var.</p>
 <p>• Variables declared with var are hoisted (they move to the top of their scope).</p>
<p>• var is older — now mostly replaced by let and const in modern JavaScript.</p>
        <pre>
<b>Example:</b>
var city = "Nagpur"; 
console.log(city);a
<br>
<b>Output:</b>
Nagpur

    </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>* Const</h2>
        <p>• const is used to declare a constant variable.</p>

 <p>• You cannot change (reassign) its value after declaring.</p>

 <p>• You cannot redeclare a const variable.</p>

 <p>• It has block scope (works only inside { }).</p>

 <p>• You must assign a value at the time of declaration.</p>
        <pre>
<b>Example:</b>
const country = "India"; 
console.log(country);
<br>
<b>Output:</b>
India
    </pre>
    </div>
